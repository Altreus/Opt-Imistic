To use

  use Opt::Imistic;
  
After this line, %Opt::Imistic::opts is populated with the parsed @ARGV. See
example.pl for a demo.

TODO

Allow supplying of defaults. Requested by f00li5h, who doesn't like to have to
do $opts{v} //= 0 a lot.

The repeated option thing does have a bug. Currently it doesn't remember that
the option didn't have a value. That means it just increments the existing value
if the option is encountered again. That, in turn, means that if you do
something like:

  example.pl --word=foo --word

you get word => 'fop' because it incremented it.

Should this be invalid, or should it add a count of un-valued options?
